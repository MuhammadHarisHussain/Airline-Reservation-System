# Airline Reservation System

An airline reservation system implemented in Python with MySQL for backend storage.  
This system allows users to search flights, book tickets, manage reservations, and perform related operations.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Search for available flights  
- Book / cancel reservations  
- Manage passenger information  
- Admin capabilities (e.g. add flights, update schedules)  
- Persistence via MySQL database  

---

## 🏗️ Architecture & Components

- **Airline Reservation System Python.py** — Main application logic (search, booking, cancellation)  
- **Airline Reservation System MySQL.sql** — SQL script to create tables, schema, and seed data  
- (Optional) Additional modules for utility, validation, UI layer  

---

## ⚙️ Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x  
- pip  
- MySQL server (or compatible SQL server)  

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MuhammadHarisHussain/Airline-Reservation-System.git
   cd Airline-Reservation-System
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (recommended)**  
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # Linux / macOS  
   venv\Scripts\activate    # Windows
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   *(If you don’t yet have a `requirements.txt`, common packages might include `mysql-connector-python`, etc.)*

4. **Set up database**  
   - Run the SQL script `Airline Reservation System MySQL.sql` in your MySQL server to create tables and seed initial data  
   - Update database connection credentials in your Python script  

5. **Run the application**  
   ```bash
   python "Airline Reservation System Python.py"
   ```

## 🗄️ Database & Schema

- The file **Airline Reservation System MySQL.sql** defines your database schema, tables (e.g. `Flights`, `Passengers`, `Reservations`, etc.), and initial test data  
- Your Python application interfaces with the database for CRUD operations  

---

## 🛠️ Usage

- Launch the Python application  
- Use menu / prompts to:
  - Search flights between origins & destinations  
  - Book a flight (select flight, enter passenger details)  
  - Cancel or view existing reservations  
  - (If admin mode exists) add or update flights

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- Better UI (CLI menu, GUI, or web frontend)  
- Input validation & error handling  
- Seat-selection interface  
- Flight scheduling / recurring flights  
- Reporting & analytics (e.g. bookings per route)  
- User authentication / admin roles  
- Integration with external APIs (airline data, payments)
